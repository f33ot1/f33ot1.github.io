It’s the end of 2025, and it’s time to reflect on my experiences. I am reflecting on my journey learning malware reverse engineering, as it has been one of the most fascinating paths I have taken. Beyond the obvious professional and career benefits, this learning journey brought me:

greater self-knowledge and a better understanding of how I approach difficult, complex, and challenging situations (both technically and in life in general);

increased patience;

a higher tolerance for frustration;

stronger troubleshooting skills;

increased confidence that I can solve challenges if I persist long enough.

In addition, I met amazing and inspiring people along the way.
